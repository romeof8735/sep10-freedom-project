### My takeaways 
My takeaways from the Expo Elevator Pitch is that you should try and limit how much you say since we had to do a lot of talking which overtime got very repetitive and tiring. We had to also limit our presentations to only 1 minute to explain your whole project. We had to speak loudly so that people could hear us presenting our projects. My takeaways from the In class Presentations is to always make sure to have a plan since without a plan it would be difficult to start. Another takeaway of mine is to come up with many ideas and write them down in your notes since later on you can take those ideas and create a plan with them. My last takeaway is to have a timeline so that way you can plan when you are going to do certain things.

### Engineering Design Process
With my Engineering Design Process I am going to use what I have learned from these presentations and all of the feedback that I have gained to help me make better and more professional presentations in the future. 

### Skills 
The skills that I have worked on was Communication and Creativity

### Communication
I had to do public speaking at the Expo and in class which helped improve my Communication skill.

### Creativity
I had to think on how I would present my project and how to make it interseting for the people I'm presentating to. I also had to think on how I can make my google sldes pop out and look good.
