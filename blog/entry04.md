### Choosing a tool
While I was looking through the tool optionx that you can pick I was interested in [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/). A frame is framework that allows for vitural reality (VR) experiences. When tinkering with a frame I decided to pick something else because I just felt like a frame was not for me so I decided to choose [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/). I chose SASS because it allows you to theoretically short the amount of code that you have to type and will allow it to still work the same. Shortening the code can actually be helpful because that allows you to code more efficiently ad safe time instead of typing out the whole line of code you can aberheate it.

### Overview
Since I was interested with SASS I decided to tinker with it in [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/showsass.php?filename=demo_sass_first). I found that you actually do save time while coding with SASS. This code is done with SASS:
```
$bgcolor: color;
$textcolor: color;
$fontsize: fontsize;
```
This code is the normal way:
```
background-color: $bgcolor;
color: $textcolor;
font-size: $fontsize;
```
As you can see in the SASS code the background color is shortened to bgcolor rather than just background-color. This abbreviation helps shorten how much you need to type and just overall shaves off some coding time.

### Engineering Design Process
With my engineering design process I am going to use SASS since it would help reduce coding time and increase efficiency. SASS can also help with things that dont exist in css like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff like that.

### Skills

#### How to Learn
While I was researching about SASS and what it can do it has helped me to build on my how to learn skill. SASS has helped me build this skill because while reading through their website and tinkering with SASS it has helped me to understand and learn how SASS works and how it can benifit me.

#### Attention to detail
My attention to detail skill also increased since I had to make sure that I spelled the abbrevitation corretly since if not then the SASS code would not work and nothing would pop up.
