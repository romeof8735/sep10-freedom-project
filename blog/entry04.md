### Choosing a tool
While I was looking through the tool optionx that you can pick I was interested in [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/). A frame is framework that allows for vitural reality (VR) experiences. When tinkering with a frame I decided to pick something else because I just felt like a frame was not for me so I decided to choose [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/). I chose SASS because it allows you to theoretically short the amount of code that you have to type and will allow it to still work the same. Shortening the code can actually be helpful because that allows you to code more efficiently ad safe time instead of typing out the whole line of code you can aberheate it.
