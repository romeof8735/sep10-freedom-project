### Choosing a Topic
The topic that I chose was Construction. I chose this topic because I use to always wonder how they managed to make these super tall buildings called skyscrapers. Researching this topic about constuction also seemed interseting since I wanted to know how they use technology when helping them build these structures that looks super modern and eye catching. One example that I have found based on this article called ["7 Positive Impacts of Construction Technology on Businesses"](https://gocodes.com/positive-impacts-construction-technology/) by GoCodes is that when the mini excavter was first created it helped Japan's housing and urbanization. Another article that I found is called ["How Smart Technology Can Transform Skyscrapers"](https://www.smartglassinternational.com/insights/smart-technology-can-transform-skyscrapers/) by Maverick and it talks about how skyscrapers use a smart glass technology that allows for the user to control how much sunlight and heat passes threw the surface of the glass. Reading these articles made me realize truly how much technology we using when constructing things. My backup topic was about technology in airplanes. The reason why I picked technology in airplanes as my backup topic is because me and my friends are very intrested in airplanes and would like to know more about them.

### Engineering Design Process
So far I am in beginning stage of my engineering desgin process where I have to define what the problem is. The problem that I'm hoping to solve is to **inform people on how much technology construction uses and why it cost so much.** The next step that I'm probably going to take is to talk with people about how much technology they think construction is using. 

### Skills 
The skills that I have learned while working on my blog is **time management and how to google information.**

#### Time Management
For this project time management is pretty important since there is a lot of researching you have to do. So I'm going to plan all my thoughts and ideas ahead of time and set certain priorities on important things to do first. Time management is a very important skill that I would like to learn so I am going to start learning this skill with the freedom project. 

#### How to google
When I used google I would search for _technology in construction_ and it would give me articles like ["CII - Construction Technology"](https://www.construction-institute.org/resources/knowledgebase/knowledge-areas/construction-technology) which just gives me a general idea. So i switched my search to _technology used in construction_ helped me find what I was looking for.
