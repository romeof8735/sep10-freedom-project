### How I made my MVP
So to start *MVP* means Minimum Viable Product which in easier terms means the basic starting point of something. For this website that we are making I made sure to add the minimum amount of things that allows for the website to work along side with images and the context and one bootstrap component. I didn't format anything yet since I was just mainly focused on getting all my content and images onto the website.

### 

### Challenges & Takeaway
One challenge that I had when making my mvp was using the *@extend* function.
```
.button-basic  {
    border: none;
    padding: 15px 30px;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 16px;
    cursor: pointer;
  }

  .button-report  {
    @extend .button-basic;
    background-color: red;
  }
```
The @extend makes it so I dont have to rewrite the .button-basic class over again with all the borders, padding, text, etc, instead I could just use @ extend then the class name and all that will be copyed to the function I want it to be copyed in. 

### Engineering Design Process
With my engineering design process I am going to use this mvp as coding experience to help me make better websites in the future. I can take my knowledge from this and use it on other porjects to help build on my coding skills and create better websites.

### Skills
The skills that I have learned while working on my blog is **time management** and **organization**

## Time management
I had to make sure to fit all my ideas into a time line to nake sure I can do all the things that I want before the deadline. 

## Organization
I had to organize all my thought and ideas into a google doc where I can just write all my ideas that I want to do and revise it later if I get any better ideas than I currently have.
