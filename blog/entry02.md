### Choosing gadets
While researching about construction I wondered _"Can hardware have benifits in consturction?"_ and so I started to search about hardware in constuction. The first website that I found talking about hardware was called ["7 GADGETS THAT ARE CHANGING THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY"](https://www.sbci.com/7-gadgets-changing-construction-industry/) by South Bay Construction. When I looked at this website it showed many devices that I have never heard about with descriptions based on their functions. The first gadget that I looked at and found interesting was called the [“Sonetics’ Bluetooth headset”](https://www.sonetics.com/industries/construction/). This gadget allows for the team to communicate with each other and work both at the same time allowing for better communication and better construction work. The headsets have a total of a whole two miles bluetooth range of communication and you can control how much noise gets in and out of the headset. You can also use the gadget in any type of condition and it will work perfectly fine. Second gadget that I found was called [“Safety Gasses from Xoeye”](https://xoi.io/). These safety glasses have cameras embedded in them that can not only record progress but it can also be projected onto a screen. When these glasses have wifi access it allows construction workers to perform precise tasks such as using 3d mapping schematics. These glasses not only increase efficiency but they also help avoid costly mistakes. Third gadget that I found was called [“Construction Drone”](https://kespry.com/aerialintelligence/industries/construction/). This gadget can help create contour maps, site plans, site surveys, model renderings and other useful real time documentations. Workers can use drones to visually inspect any area or monitor progress. The drone is able to monitor hundreds of acres while also conducting activities such as surveys without needing to be interacted with. After the drone collects necessary data it can then upload that data to the cloud platform so that it can be processed according to the needs of the project.

### Choosing Apps
The google search that I used to find some apps was "Construction Apps" and the first website that I found interesting was called ["10 Best Contractor Apps That You’ll Actually Use in 2024"](https://wheniwork.com/blog/10-best-apps-for-construction) by Sam Campbell. When I looked at this website it contained many different types of apps which linked you to their website that goes in more description about what the app has to offer. The first app I looked at was called ["LetsBuild"](https://www.letsbuild.com/). This app can track information on project progression. It can generate progress reports and other necessary documents. It can also track any progress and share it in real time even if you are outside or inside. This app offers a free trial then annual subscriptions and you should contact them first to see what is the best package for what you will be doing. The second app I looked at was called ["Fieldwire"](https://www.fieldwire.com/). This app is a tool that focuses on blueprint management. With this app users can markup drawings, add notes, and attach or view photos of projects of the process directly. This app can also schedule construction work for the day with the project plans. There is a free plan with a 5 user limit then a plan starts at $29 a user each month

### Engineering Design Process
With my engineering design process im first going to see **how many people know about these softwares and hardwares.** After I see how popular or unpopular these apps and gadgets are I am either going to find one that is less popular are stay with these. 

### Skills 
The skills that I have learned while working on my blog is **.**
