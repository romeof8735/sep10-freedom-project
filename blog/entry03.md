### Context for my webite
The website I will be making will talk about how software and hardware can help benefit in construction. The website will also tell you exactly how these softwares and hardware can benefit in Construction and have links to each one if you want to read directly from their website, download the software, or buy their hardware at the end of this website. 

### Intro for my website
Construction has been around for thousands of thousands of years. Construction is being used everyday even as you are reading this. Some construction jobs require years of work which is why I will be talking about how we can work towards a faster and more efficient way of doing construction in the near future. 

### Overview
Technology can help not only speed up construction time but it can also help keep the workers safer with these softwares and hardwares that I will talk about. 

### Present tech inventions that can help in construction
The first software app I found was called [LetsBuild](https://www.letsbuild.com/).This app can track information on project progression. It can generate progress reports and other necessary documents. It can also track any progress and share it in real time even if you are outside or inside. This app offers a free trial then annual subscriptions and you should contact them first to see what is the best package for what you will be doing.

The second software app I looked at was called [Fieldwire](https://www.fieldwire.com/). This app is a tool that focuses on blueprint management. With this app users can markup drawings, add notes, and attach or view photos of projects of the process directly. This app can also schedule construction work for the day with the project plans. There is a free plan with a 5 user limit then a plan starts at $29 a user each month.
