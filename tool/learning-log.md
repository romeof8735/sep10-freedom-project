* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* With SASS it opens a whole new world when writing code in your CSS
* In this [basic tutorial from w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/) it explains how SASS is different from your normal CSS
* As you can see from the SASS tutorial it helps reduce the amount of repetition
* Normal you would do `background-color: color;` for CSS to change the background color of your website but with SASS you can do `bgcolor: color;` and this will do the same thing but more efficiently since you have to type less
* [Now its your turn](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/showsass.php?filename=demo_sass_first) by trying out that demo since the first step to learning something is by reading and then actually trying to do it yourself

* I would recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDIJa0AP5c) that sums up what SASS is in under 3 minutes
* The person who explains this video talks a bit fast but what he is basically explaining is that SASS has 3 important features that CSS doesnt have which is "Nesting" "Mixins" and "Functions"
* One thing that I thought was pretty cool is that if you remember anything that we did in code.org when we were in 9th grade was that we would use things such as if or else and in SASS functions they also use that same if or else
* If you want to watch a bit longer video of someone explaining these things in detail I would recommend watching this [20 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6eOVaaelI)
